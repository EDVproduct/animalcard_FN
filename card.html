                        The honeybee is the best known bee species because of the general appearance and the large numbers of specimens. The honeybee is appreciated by humans because of the important role as pollinator of many plant species such as fruit trees. In addition, the honeybee is the most important supplier of various natural products such as honey, beeswax, royal jelly and propolis.
